# Velocity

1. Clone this branch

2. Install Cocoapods (one time ting)
    sudo gem install cocoapods
    
3. Run "pod install" in the directory with the Podfile (should be main directory)

4. Open "Droppin.xcworkspace" to run the app.


NOTE:

Don't open "Droppin.xcodeproj" to work on the app.
xcodeproj doesn't work after installing Firebase. Use xcworkspace.
